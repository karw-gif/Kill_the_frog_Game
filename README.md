Kill the Frog is a simple interactive 2D game built collaboratively to demonstrate core game development concepts such as user input handling, collision detection, and object lifecycle management.

In the game, the player can eliminate the frog by clicking on it. Additionally, when the frog collides with the lake, it automatically disappears from the scene, simulating a loss or removal condition. These mechanics showcase how mouse events and collision triggers are handled in a game environment.

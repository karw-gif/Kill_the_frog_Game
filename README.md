Meet Kill the Frog — a tiny, chaotic 2D game where one frog is having a very bad day.

The rules are simple:

Click the frog → it’s gone

Let it touch the lake → it disappears

That’s it. No long tutorials, no complicated controls — just quick reactions, clean logic, and a bit of fun.

Behind the scenes, this project plays with core game-dev ideas like click detection, collision handling, and object destruction. It was built collaboratively, making it just as much about teamwork and learning as it is about gameplay.

🎮 Why this game exists

To practice handling user input (clicks)

To learn collision detection the fun way

To understand how game objects live… and disappear

To collaborate using GitHub without breaking things 😄

Simple, playful, and beginner-friendly — Kill the Frog is proof that even the smallest games can teach big ideas.
